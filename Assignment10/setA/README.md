Define a class ‘Fraction’ having integer data members numerator and denominator. </br>
Define parameterized and default constructors (default values 0 and 1). Parameterized constructor should store the fraction in reduced form after dividing both numerator and denominator by gcd(greatest common divisor). Write a private function member to compute gcd of two integers. </br>
Write four member functions for addition, subtraction. multiplication and division of fraction objects. Each function will have two fraction objects as arguments. </br>
Write the main function to illustrate the use of the class.
